initSidebarItems({"trait":[["AsHttpSignature","`AsHttpSignature` defines a trait for getting an Authorization or Signature Header string from any type that implements it. It provides three methods: `as_http_signature`, which implementors must define, and `authorization_header` and `signature_header`, which use `as_http_signature` to create the header string."],["GetKey","The `GetKey` trait is used during HTTP Signature verification to access the required decryption key based on a given `key_id`."],["VerifyHeader","The `VerifyHeader` trait is meant to be implemented for the request types from http libraries (such as Hyper and Rocket). This trait makes verifying requests much easier, since the `verify_authorization_header()` and `verify_signature_header()` methods can be called directly on a Request type."],["WithHttpSignature","`WithHttpSignature` defines a trait for adding Authorization and Signature headers to another library's request or response object."]]});
